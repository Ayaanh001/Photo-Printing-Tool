**Photo Printing Tool** is a lightweight web app built to solve a common issue: printing wallet-size or custom-sized photos directly from your **phone** or **Windows 11 PC**.

Most phones and apps don’t provide photo size options when printing at home, and **Windows 11** removed the classic photo print layout from Windows 10 — making printing harder.

This tool brings back the convenience — especially useful for printing **wallet-size photos for school projects** and saving time with your **home printer**.

## **Features**

- Print **wallet-size** and custom-size photos
- **Preview box** shows how photos will appear on paper
- Works on **phones, tablets, and PCs**  
- Great for **kids school project work**  
- Clean and simple drag-and-drop interface  
- Compatible with **Windows 11** and older  
- Works fully **offline**


## **How to Use**

1. **Download** the `photo-print-tool.html` file from this repository.
2. **Open** it in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
3. **Upload** the photos you want to print.
4. In the print window:  Select **Landscape orientation** and Adjust print settings (size, quality, etc.) if needed.
6. **Print and enjoy!**

## **Coming Soon**
