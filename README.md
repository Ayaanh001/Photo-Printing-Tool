**Photo Printing Tool** is a lightweight web app built to solve a common issue: printing wallet-size or custom-sized photos directly from your **phone** or **Windows 11 PC**.

Most phones and apps don’t provide photo size options when printing at home, and **Windows 11** removed the classic photo print layout from Windows 10 — making printing harder.

This tool brings back the convenience — especially useful for printing **wallet-size photos for school projects** and saving time with your **home printer**.

- Compatible with **Windows 11** and older  
- **No installation** required — works fully offline

1. **Download** the `photo-print-tool.html` file from this repository.
2. **Open** it in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
